# 🎨 Color Detection Project

This project is a simple real-time color detection application using a computer camera.  
It is developed in Python with the OpenCV library for image and video processing.  
The project is built and tested using Anaconda and Visual Studio Code.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Captures live video feed from the computer camera.  
- 🖼️ Processes each video frame to detect specific colors.  
- 🔴🟢🔵 Highlights and displays the detected color regions in real-time.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📦 OpenCV  
- 📦 NumPy  
- (Optional) 🐍 Anaconda environment for easier package management

---

## ⚙️ Installation

To install the required Python libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy

▶️ How to Run
 1. 🐍 Open your Anaconda environment or any Python environment you prefer.
 2. 🗂️ Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code or any IDE.
 3. ▶️ Run the main script (e.g., main.py) using the command:

python main.py

 4. 📸 The camera will open, and you can move different colored objects in front of it to see color detection in action.

🔍 How It Works
 • 🎞️ The program captures video frames from the camera in real-time.
 • 🎨 Each frame is processed to identify colors based on predefined color ranges.
 • 🖌️ Detected color areas are highlighted and shown to the user on the screen.

💡 Use Cases
 • 🎓 Educational purposes to understand image processing basics.
 • 🤖 Introduction to computer vision projects.
 • 🎨 Basic color analysis for robotics or artistic applications.

⚠️ Notes
 • 📷 Make sure your camera is properly connected and accessible by the program.
 • 🔧 You may need to adjust color range values in the code depending on your lighting conditions.
 • 🚀 This project uses OpenCV’s capabilities for real-time image processing.
